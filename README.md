# Linear Super-Resolution through Translational Motion

## Purpose

This software focuses on the problem of computing a single
super-resolved image from multiple shifted images of the same scene.
	
It is made of two **independent packages**, one implemented in C, and
the other in Matlab, stored in the two following directories:

+ [c](c): package (sources + documentation) in C language;
+ [matlab](matla): package (source + documentation) in C language.

You can install and use either one or both of those two packages
independently.
	
## Installation and documentations

+ Documentation and installation instructions for the C package are available [here](c/README.md).
+ Documentation and installation instructions for the Matlab package is available [here](matlab/README.md).
