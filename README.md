# Linear Super-Resolution through Translational Motion

## Purpose

This software focuses on the problem of computing a single
super-resolved image from multiple shifted images of the same scene.

It is made of two **independent packages**, one implemented in C, and
the other in Matlab, stored in the two following directories:

+ [c](c): package ([sources](c/src) + [documentation](c/README.md)) in C language;
+ [matlab](matlab): package ([sources](matlab/src) + [documentation](matlab/README.md)) in C language.

You can install and use either one or both of those two packages
independently.
